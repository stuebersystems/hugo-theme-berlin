# Berlin - A Hugo theme

Berlin is a simple Bootstrap 4 based [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme for a blog website. It uses pure [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com) without any custom CSS and [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com) Web Font for icons. The idea is to give you a framework for easy additional customization (e.g. CSS, custom fonts or own Bootstrap theme). This theme includes a sample blog for demonstration.

<small>This theme is based on [Hugo Bootstrap v4 Theme](https://github.com/Xzya/hugo-bootstrap)</small>

## Installation (under Windows)

Assuming you have already installed hugo you should:	

1. Open the Windows command prompt

2. Run `hugo new site c:\myblog`. A new hugo project will be created.

3. Switch to that newly created folder with `cd c:\myblog`.

Now you need to install the Berlin theme. You can do that by cloning the GitHub repository with Git or by manually copying the files.

With Git:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/stuebersystems/hugo-theme-berlin c:\myblog\themes\berlin`

Manually:

1. Open a Web browser and go to `https://github.com/stuebersystems/hugo-theme-berlin`

2. Download the repository as zip archive.

3. Extract the files to `c:\myblog\themes`.

4. Rename the extracted folder `themes\hugo-berlin-theme` to `themes\berlin`.

You are now ready to configure your blog and to write your first article. 

## Sample blog

Let's set up a sample blog:

1. Go to `themes\berlin\exampleSite` and copy all files to `c:\myblog\`.

2. Run `hugo`. This will create your static pages under `c:\myblog\public`.

3. Run `hugo server` to start the embedded web server.

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1313`.

4. Voil√†!

You can now study this example:

1. Sample configuration is inside `c:\myblog\config.toml`.

2. Sample custom CSS is found under `c:\myblog\static`

3. Sample custom layout overwrites are found under `c:\myblog\layouts`

4. And the sample blog posts are found under `c:\myblog\content`.
